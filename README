Rainbowball Game:
	A basic SDL project (using SDL 1.2) with graphics and music.
	(As of 6/15/2014, there is no further functionality).

Author: Tim Smith (tim14smith@gmail.com)

Requires (for compilation):
	libsdl1.2-dev
	libsdl-image1.2
	libsdl-mixer1.2
	libsdl-ttf2.0-0
	gcc
	make
	
Install - Windows
The libraries are cross platform, and a Windows binary is included in the Win32bin directory with all of the runtime dependencies.

Simply run rainbowball-game.exe from that directory.
	-This has not been updated, though (as of 6/15/2014), so it will not have any of the new features that are in the linux version now.

Install - Linux
	Install the dependencies above (through your method of choice).
	Run make in the same directory as the makefile.
	Run the executeable (rainbowball-game) that was generated from make.
